# PHAS0052---Physics-Group-Project
Reproducing the 2011-2012 CMS analysis to find the Higgs boson using the CMSSW (CMS Software package) and ROOT (high energy physics data analysis framework). The analysis was done following the https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/HiggsExample20112012 analysis. The HiggsDemoAnalyzer is diretly downloaded from the analysis repository, it's completely their work, while the python config files are an edited version of the original. The main files are my work, I used them to simplify running the analysis on ~70 index files by iterating through them with the main files. The final_plotter script is also downloaded from the original github repository, and only contains a few edits made by me.
